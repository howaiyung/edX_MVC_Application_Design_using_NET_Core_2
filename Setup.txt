To initialize a server in .Net Core 2.0

Launch and Debug The Web Application in Visual Studio Code

    Use View|Explorer or Ctrl+Shift+E to open the Explorer panel. You should see all the source code of the project.
    Open Program.cs or Startup.cs. Wait for about ten seconds, you should see a warning message “Required assets to build and debug are missing from ‘HelloMVC’. Add them?". Click "Yes” button, Visual Studio Code will create a project root level folder called .vscode. There are two critical configuration files in the folder - launch.json and tasks.json.
    Use View|Debug or Ctrl+Shift+D to open the Debug panel. Look at the toolbar on the top, you should see the Start Debug (green triangle) button, the dropdown list for picking proper configuration, and the Open launch.json (gear) button. The selected configuration should be ".NET Core Launch (web)". This configuration is generated by operations in step 2. Please note, if you see a red dot on the gear button, just restart Visual Studio Code, then the red dot will disappear. It is a bug in current version Visual Studio Code (1.16.1), as of the writing of this content.
    Click the Start Debug button. Visual Studio Code will start the web application and launch the web browser to access http://localhost:5000.
    To stop the debugging, you have to click the Stop (red rectangle) button. Closing the web browser won't stop the debugging.
    Switch to the Explorer panel. Open the file Controllers\HomeController.cs. Find the About method and change the code ViewData["Message"] = "Your application description page."; to ViewData["Message"] = "This is my first ASP.NET Core web application!";.
    Set a break point on this line and run the application again.
    In the web browser, click the “About” hyperlink on the navigation bar, you should see the execution hit the break point. Continue the execution, you should see "This is my first ASP.NET Core web application!" shows on the About page.

Remove Generated Assets

There are three project root level folders that are very critical to us - the Models folder, the Controllers folder, and the Views folder. For our practices in the course, we always start from scratch. So, let's clear those auto-generated assets from these three folders.

The best way to do that is delete and recreate the folders. If the integrated terminal of your Visual Studio Code is PowerShell, please comfirm the working directory is C:\Projects\HelloMVC then run the command below:

Remove-Item .\Models -Force -Recurse
Remove-Item .\Views -Force -Recurse
Remove-Item .\Controllers -Force -Recurse
New-Item .\Models -Type directory
New-Item .\Views -Type directory
New-Item .\Controllers -Type directory

If the terminal is cmd.exe, please confirm the working directory is C:\Projects\HelloMVC then run the commands below:

rd Models /s /q
rd Views /s /q
rd Controllers /s /q
md Models
md Views
md Controllers

You can also do the delete-recreate operation with Visual Studio Code manually in the explorer view.
